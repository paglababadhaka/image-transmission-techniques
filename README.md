**Image Transmission Technique Comparison using PCM, FM, and SSB in MATLAB**

**Overview:**
This report proposes a comprehensive study and comparison of three well-known image
transmission techniques: Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and
Single Sideband Modulation (SSB). Matlab app simulation will be used for this project. This
project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of these modulation techniques in the
context of image transmission.

**Project Objectives:**
● Implement Modulation Techniques
● Evaluate Signal Quality
● Visualize and Compare Results
● Document Code and Methodology
